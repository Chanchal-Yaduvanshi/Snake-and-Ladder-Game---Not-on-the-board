# Snake-and-Ladder-Game---Not-on-the-board
Python script which simulates the classic game of Snake and Ladder between two players.

**How it Works**

The script imports the Image module from PIL to display the game board.
The show_board function opens and displays the game board image using PIL.
Defines functions to check for snakes and ladders on the board and return the new position accordingly.
The play function allows players to take turns rolling a dice.
Each player's position is updated based on the dice roll and checked for snakes or ladders.
They can choose to continue rolling the dice or quit the game.
If a player reaches the end position (100), they win the game.
The game ends when one of the players reaches the end position or chooses to quit.
